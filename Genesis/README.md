# Genesis

## getReports.js

Downloads [reports](../docs/reports.md) from Genesis that are used by the other scripts to get information about current students, teachers, classes, and schools.

*NOTE:*You must have curl installed for this to work. Large file downloads don't work well in casperjs, so curl is used instead.
