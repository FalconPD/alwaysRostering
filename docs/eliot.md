# Eliot Format
Several subscription services only utilize a single database and do not allow for repeating usernames across any of their customers. As such, a very unique username must be chosen.

Eliot's format utilizes a short school code:
```
<Short School Code> is bb, bs, ml, wl, ot, ag, ms, and hs for Barclay Brook, Brookside, Mill Lake, Woodland, Oak Tree, Applegarth, Monroe Township Middle School, and Monroe Township High School respectively.
```
Eliot's format for student usernames is:
```
<Short School Code><Student ID>
```
Eliot's format for student passwords is:
```
<Short School Code>123456
```
Eliot's format for teacher usernames is the long form of their email:
```
<FirstName>.<LastName>@monroe.k12.nj.us
```
